This project is a logging and notification application that runs in the system tray. It utilizes flite on *nix or SAPI on Windows to speak messages aloud and libnotify or the system tray to show messages in text.

It provides screenshot logging and hourly notifications, as well as reminders for scheduled events, and clipboard logging. Both logging services are opt-in.
